# References (?)

The following is a list with urls or references to stuff that I read while
implementing this project. The urls below link to articles on various facets
of lisp/scheme-like languages, such as continuations, coroutines, lexical
scoping and garbage collection.

- ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/cs345/schintro-v13/schintro_toc.html
(which is anything but complete)
- http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Books/ProgLangs/2007-04-26/
- Lua's garbage collection mechanism
- TinyScheme's general organization
- A bunch of other schemes that really didn't help much.
