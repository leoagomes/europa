## Notes Area

What I need to do _now_:

-> implement **mark** and **destroy** "methods" for all primitives
-> write tests for these.
-> write last tests for the GC

What I need to do after:

-> closure implementation
-> try to figure out an execution method (and function calling API)
-> maybe check on continuations and their implemnetations.
   +-> find references in the paper about implementation strategies.
