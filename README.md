# Europa

Europa aims to be a lightweight, (reasonably) fast, embeddable scripting language inspired by lisp/scheme and Lua.

## But why?

I like scheme, a lot, but most embeddable versions of scheme are either too encumbered, too complex, or dependant on libraries/specific systems, which is something I am not too fond of. I wanted specific features on my scheme implementations, like being able to completely disable file ports, but sometimes it was just too complicated to do something like that (I'm looking at you, TinyScheme and s7). The advantage of implementing my own is that I can ~~copy~~ apply concepts from other languages into this one.

## Building, etc.

At the moment, this project is under heavy development, with not much useful and
not much defined, so if you're interested, please chech the source code and the
roadmap.
